# KCC Pi Kiosk — System Overview

**Raspberry Pi Kiosk Configuration for Kelowna Curling Club**

---

## Overview

The KCC Pi Kiosk system drives every television screen in the Kelowna Curling Club. Each screen is powered by a Raspberry Pi that can be configured to display one of two modes:

- **Camera Mode** — live RTSP video feeds from overhead cameras above the curling sheets
- **Kiosk Mode** — rotating advertising content displayed in a web browser

Configuration is performed by connecting to each Pi over SSH. On login, a menu-driven interface is automatically presented to the operator — no technical knowledge of Linux is required.

## Repository

```
https://github.com/garjones/pi-kiosk
```

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `kiosk.sh` | SSH configuration menu (whiptail TUI). Auto-runs on login and auto-updates from GitHub. |
| `kiosk.run.sh` | Display engine. Reads the config file on boot and launches the appropriate content. |
| `kiosk.config` | Single-line config file written by `kiosk.sh` and read by `kiosk.run.sh`. |
| `kiosk.service` | systemd service that runs `kiosk.run.sh` on boot. |
| `unclutter.service` | systemd service that hides the mouse cursor. |
| `cameras-all.sh` | Utility script for testing all camera feeds. |
| `tiny-test.mp4` | Local test video used in place of RTSP streams during development. |

---

## Display Modes

### Camera Mode — Two Sheets (`C`)

Displays live feeds for **two curling sheets** simultaneously. Each sheet has two cameras (Home end and Away end), producing a **2×2 video mosaic**. A thin column of sheet number labels runs down the centre, and the Pi's IP address is shown in a bar along the bottom.

```
┌──────────────┬─────┬──────────────┐
│  Sheet N     │  N  │  Sheet N     │
│  Away Camera │     │  Home Camera │
├──────────────┼─────┼──────────────┤
│  Sheet M     │  M  │  Sheet M     │
│  Away Camera │     │  Home Camera │
├──────────────┴─────┴──────────────┤
│         IP Address Bar            │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Camera Mode — Single Sheet (`S`)

Displays live feeds for **one curling sheet** only. The Home and Away cameras for that sheet are shown side by side in the bottom half of the screen. The top half is blank.

### Kiosk / Advertising Mode (`K`)

Displays a **web-based advertising carousel** using Chromium in fullscreen kiosk mode. Two advertising channels are available:

| Code | Location |
|---|---|
| `K01` | Upstairs |
| `K02` | Practice Ice (Downstairs) |

---

## Configuration File Format

The configuration is stored as a single line in `/home/kcckiosk/kiosk.config`.

```
{Rotation}{Mode}{BottomSheet}{TopSheet}
```

| Position | Length | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 char | Screen orientation | `H` = Horizontal, `V` = Vertical |
| 2 | 1 char | Display mode | `C` = Club cameras, `S` = Single camera, `K` = Kiosk |
| 3–4 | 2 chars | Bottom sheet number | `01`–`12` |
| 5–6 | 2 chars | Top sheet number | `01`–`12` |

**Example:** `HC010203` → Horizontal, Club cameras, showing sheets 2 (top) and 1 (bottom).

> For Kiosk mode (`K`), only chars 3–4 are used (to select the advertising channel number).

## Camera Hardware

The club has **12 curling sheets**, each covered by two [Axis IP cameras](https://www.axis.com):

- **Home camera** — pointed at the home end of the sheet
- **Away camera** — pointed at the away end of the sheet

Cameras stream via **RTSP** and are accessed using:

```
rtsp://root:missionav@<camera-ip>/axis-media/media.amp
```

Cameras are distributed across two internal subnets:

| Subnet | Usage |
|---|---|
| `10.100.1.x` | Primary camera network |
| `10.200.30.x` | Secondary camera network |

---

## System Services

Two systemd services run on each Pi:

| Service | Unit File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `kiosk` | `kiosk.service` | Launches `kiosk.run.sh` on boot to display content |
| `unclutter` | `unclutter.service` | Hides the mouse cursor after a short idle period |

A **daily cron job** reboots each Pi automatically at 7:00 AM to ensure a clean state each day:

```cron
0 7 * * * /sbin/shutdown -r now
```

---

## SSH Configuration Access

Each Pi can be configured by connecting via SSH:

```
Host:     10.200.30.xxx
User:     kcckiosk
Password: kcc12345
```

On login, the configuration menu launches automatically. No shell commands are needed — simply navigate the menus to select the desired display mode, confirm, and the Pi will reboot and begin displaying the new content.

---

## Configuration Menu Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Club Cameras** | Select a pre-defined pair of adjacent sheets (1&2, 3&4, etc.) |
| **Single Camera** | Display one sheet only |
| **Custom Cameras** | Manually enter any two sheet numbers |
| **Kiosk** | Select an advertising display channel |
| **Software Update** | Run `apt update` / `apt upgrade` |
| **Raspberry Config** | Open `raspi-config` for system-level settings |
| **Install Kiosk** | Install/re-install the kiosk services |
| **Reboot** | Reboot the Pi immediately |

---

## Auto-Update

Each time the configuration menu is opened (i.e. on every SSH login), `kiosk.sh` automatically downloads the latest versions of `kiosk.run.sh`, `kiosk.service`, and `unclutter.service` from GitHub before presenting the menu. This ensures all Pis are always running the current software without manual intervention.

---

## Development & Testing

The display script (`kiosk.run.sh`) detects whether it is running on a Raspberry Pi or a macOS/Linux dev machine:

- **On Pi:** Uses live RTSP camera streams and `kmsprint` to detect screen resolution
- **On Mac/Dev:** Substitutes `tiny-test.mp4` for all camera feeds and assumes a 1920×1080 resolution, opening streams in Google Chrome instead of Chromium
